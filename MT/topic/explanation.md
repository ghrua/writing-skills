&#x1F4D8; **explanation method**

+ Besides the basic desire from a scientific viewpoint to clarify their workings, it is often the case that it is important to understand why a machine learning algorithm made a particular choice.

  + Tag: **motivation**
+ LSTM's can be costly to run in the production compared to descrete models with lookup tables and pattern matching.
