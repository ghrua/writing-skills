+ what these models learn about language remains an open science question

&#x1F4D8;  **a lot of previous works ...**

+ an emerging body of work investigates this question through probes, ...


## Experiments

  + While the MLP performed marginally better at recognizing many categories, ...


&#x1F4D8; **much better than**

+ **considerably better**

+ **substantially more accurate**
  + , was substantially more accurate at predicting ...

&#x1F4D8; **at lower risk of**

+ **be less prone to**
  + The linear probe was considerably less prone to this error.

&#x1F4D8; **investigate ...**

+ **shed light on**
  + we use selectivity to shed light on confounding factors.
